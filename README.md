# PROJECT-BMA
The Budget Monitoring Application (BMA) is a prototype designed to simplify expense tracking and budget management for users. It offers a range of features including receipt scanning, predictive expense analysis, account management, and budgeting strategies. Please note that this application is currently in prototype stage and is under active development. While many features are functional, not all features may be stable or fully implemented. I am continuously working on improving and stabilizing the application to provide a robust and user-friendly experience.
